* This is a 3D printable robot with MBED control software. It uses signal processing to reduce the component count normally associated with quadrature encoding.
* There are also lots of other objects defined in [Solid Python](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) loosely associated with the project
* Version 0.1

The build and all the dependencies for the software come from [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/).

The 3D models require [Solid Python](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) and [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)

TODO: The hardware needs some explanation
